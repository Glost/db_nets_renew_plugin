# Renew DB-Nets Plugin UML Class Diagram

The UML class diagram of the Renew DB-Nets Plugin.

Only classes implemented/interfaces declared inside plugin are shown together with classes/interfaces which are inherited/implemented by them (the latter are shown without class members) respectively.
The plugin's classes which override only constructor, the GUI and utility classes as well as the autogenerated classes are not shown in order to save the visibility as much as possible.
