# Renew DB-nets Plugin Output (Binaries)

Anton Rigin, HSE University, Moscow, Russia, 2019 - 2020.

The parts of the Renew software tool source code are used.

The `.bat`/`.sh` files may be used on the Windows/Linux for the running the Renew with the DB-nets plugin and GUI.

The `.lnk` file may be used on the Windows as well, but changing the path to the `loader.jar` in the user's local file system is necessary.

The `config`, `libs` and `plugins` folders should be in one folder with the `loader.jar` file.

The samples of the db-nets are in the [`../samples`](../samples) folder (files with the `.rnw` extension).
