  abstract = {The design of complex Petri net models is a challenge with respect
        to intuition, correctness and efficiency. In the case that systems'
        models are of large scale and consist of numerous nets, as in the
        case of Petri net-based software engineering, net components - an
        implementation of a pattern-based approach - are applied successfully.
        This paper summarizes our efforts made and experiences with net components.
        It illustrates the concept, design and usage of net components. It
        additionally presents the experiences gained from several software
        development projects over the last few years.
        
        Net components are subnets that are combined with each other to form
        a Petri net. By this component-based approach of constructing Petri
        nets, the construction of nets is facilitated as well as accelerated,
        and the Petri nets are structured in an intuitive, easily readable
        and unified way. To illustrate the presented concepts, some net components
        that are frequently used in an agent-oriented approach in the context
        of Mulan are introduced. Besides the fact that they provide the basic
        functionality in regard to the communication that is done by protocol
        nets, also some simple patterns and programming artifacts are introduced
        into the development process.},
