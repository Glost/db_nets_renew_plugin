Known properties of the nc plugin:
user.toolsdir   : set to the path where the default tools are located.


Obsolete options:
nc.init	        : (boolean) if true the default palette is loaded on startup,
                : if the gui.autostart is not set to false

Hint:
If you want to show the AIP palette on startup try

  de.renew.diagram.init=true

in your ~/.renew.properties
