     This file can be included in the build.xml of many Renew
     components or plugins. The ideal location for inclusion
     is inside the "init" target.

     If you want to configure them for your local build  environment,
     edit the file 'local.properties' in this directory.
     The properties of interest are:
     - dir.renew.dist.plugins    - location of the Renew plugins directory
