The file RenewApplicationStub is not intended to be distributed, it has to
be ripped from a Java Developer installation under MacOS X.
However, it is needed to create the Apple-specific application bundle.
On MacOS X systems with Developer tools installed, the jarbundler task
uses the installed JavaApplicationStub as a fallback, which is better than
the may-be-outdated file in the internal Renew developer repository.
