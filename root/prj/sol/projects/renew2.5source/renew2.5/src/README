Used Tools (not included in the repository)
-------------------------------------------

The versions listed are the versions installed in the FBI-RZ Hamburg.
The override notes are needed if your software installation differs
from the default locations. Most probably, you will need to follow
Tip A) below before you are able to build Renew at home.

The tools are separated into two categories: mandatory and optional.
Mandatory tools are required by every ant run, optional tools are
needed for specific purposes only.

Tips for compilation and execution (in Unix syntax)
---------------------------------------------------

A) To configure the build process:
   - Run
     ant configure
     to ensure that the file Renew/ant/local.properties
     is generated.
   - Configure the properties in Renew/ant/local.properties,
     possibly overriding properties defined in
     Renew/ant/commonproperties.xml .

B) To build from scratch: 
   - Run "ant" on top level (Renew/)
   - The distribution tree (including all plugin components) 
     will be created in Renew/dist
   Note: The default ant target is 'dist', which compiles all plugins
         intended for distribution. Developers at the FBI-RZ Hamburg
         should use 'all' to compile all experimental plugins. Similar
         distinction exists for the 'clean' and 'cleanall' targets.

C) To run the application:
   - Go to the Renew/dist directory and execute
     java -jar loader.jar gui
   - The java -jar command will not use any given classpath,
     neither from environment variable nor from -classpath option.
     If you want to use your own classes with Renew plugins or 
     within simulations, execute
     java -Dde.renew.classPath=<yourOwnClasspath> -jar loader.jar gui
   - If you want to use own classes behind the back of Renew, execute
     java -classpath loader.jar:<anyOtherClasspath> de.renew.plugin.Loader gui
     Renew can then use your classes, but your classes will not
     see any Renew classes.
   - The 'gui' command at the end of these lines can be replaced by
     any other command registered at the PluginManager. If you have
     the PromptPlugin installed, you can omit the initial command 
     at the command line and use the interactive prompt instead.

D) To configure with more than one plugin directory:
   - Create a Renew configuration file. There are two locations:
     either ".renew.properties" in your home directory (i.e. ~/.renew.properties)
     or "renew.properties" in the directory Renew/dist/config .
   - Put a line of the form
     pluginLocations=/a/path/to/plugins:/an/other/path/to/plugins
     in there. The default plugin location is automatically included.
