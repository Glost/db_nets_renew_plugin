    This package contains the basic algorithms that are
    used during the search for an activated binding.
    Classes and interfaces remain very abstract here:
    We talk about things that may be searched and things
    that may be executed, but do not give any concrete
    examples.
    <p>
    The main class here is the <tt>Searcher</tt>, which
    coordinates various <tt>Binder</tt>s and notifies a
    <tt>Finder</tt> once a suitable binding of a
    <tt>Searchable</tt> is found.
    Then <tt>Executable</tt>s are built from the
    <tt>Occurrence</tt>s that are involved in the binding.
    <p>
    All classes in this package are expected to be called within
    simulation threads.</p>
