    This package defines the <tt>SearchQueue</tt>, which is responsible
    for keeping track of possibly enabled <tt>Searchables</tt> so
    that they can later on be searched for activated binding.
    The search queue is also keeping track of the current simulation
    time, so that it may order the searchables according to the earliest
    possible time when a search may possibly succeed.
    <p>
    All classes in this package are expected to be called within
    simulation threads.</p>
