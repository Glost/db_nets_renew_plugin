    Transition inscriptions augment a transition's behaviour.
    The inscriptions defined in this package are by no way
    exhaustive, but represent the most commonly used inscriptions.
    <p>
      All classes in this package are expected to be called within
      simulation threads. But since inscriptions are not used from
      outside the engine or compilers, we did not bother to insert
      thread assertions.
