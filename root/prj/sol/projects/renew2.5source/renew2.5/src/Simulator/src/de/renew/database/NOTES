Notes on the use of the net database
====================================

For database-backed nets initial marking inscriptions may not
create additional net instances. This would result in untimely
or missing updates to the database and a possibly corrupted 
database state! The creation of net instances can only be
undone if performed in an inscription like
  n:new net
and not by creating the net instance directly!

Is it required to send a rollback message to the transaction objects?
Unless they access the database right away, this could be handled
by the garbage collector.

After one binding of a search result set has been executed,
no further binding that was found in the same search
may be executed again, because new net instances may have been
created. These should not be used by more than one
binding. Reusing bindings makes little sense anyway, because
the bindings are probably disabled.
