    A simulator makes sure to retrieve searchables from the
    search queue and to search them for activated binding.
    the binding are then executed with a policy suitable for
    the simulator, be it concurrently or sequentially.
    <p>
    Many classes in this package are expected to be called within
    simulation threads:
    </p>
    <ul>
       <li>all Finders, </li>
       <li>Binding, and </li>
       <li>all constructors and internal methods of Simulators. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    Most methods within the <code>Simulator</code> interface
    automatically wrap their execution within a simulation thread.
    The following classes serve to provide simulation threads and
    appropriate wrappers:
    </p>
    <ul>
       <li>SimulationThreadPool, </li>
       <li>BlockingSimulationCallable, and </li>
       <li>BlockingSimulationRunnable. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    Some classes are merely considered as utility classes and may be
    used outside of simulation threads:
    </p>
    <ul>
       <li>all Comparators, </li>
       <li>BindingList, and </li>
       <li>SimulatorEventQueue. </li>
    </ul>
