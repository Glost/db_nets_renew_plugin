      Contains some additional or enhanced task implementations
      for the Apache Ant tool. These tasks are needed for the Ant
      build process when compiling Renew. They are <em>not</em>
      needed to run or compile Renew itself.

      <p>
	The classes of this package are spread across several
	plugins (e.g. RenewAnt, Misc and Gui), depending on the
	dependencies of each task (some tasks use Renew classes).
